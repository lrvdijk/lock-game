Lock Game
=========

This program is part of a present I've created for a roommate for a 
traditional Dutch event called "Sinterklaas". The person got a present, but it
was locked by a combination lock. My roommate was assigned to find the right
combination for the lock, using this program. 

Scenario
--------

- The physical combination lock must be imagined as a digital lock
- You hooked up your laptop to the digital lock using JTAG
- Now find the right combination
